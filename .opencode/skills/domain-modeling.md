# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline — challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise.

## File structure

A single-context repo looks like:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. Create files lazily — only when you have something to write.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with existing language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately.

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term.

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios that probe edge cases.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees.

### Update CONTEXT.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:
1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons
